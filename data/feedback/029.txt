I wore this to a company holiday event and wanted something that would stand out.  I loved that it had long sleeves, making it feel modern but also more ideal for a company event, given that it did run short on me, being tall.  I got several compliments on the dress.  It fit well and the jersey material made it comfortable and stay in place.
