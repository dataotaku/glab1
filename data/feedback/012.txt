This dress was absolutely gorgeous and I received so many compliments!  I wore it to a black tie NYE wedding, and even though it was short, I felt like the fabric, fit, and the way it sparkled made it fit in just fine with the other formal gowns.  I usually wear a 6 or an 8 in dresses.  I ordered a 4 and a 6, and true to other reviewers' comments, the 4 fit me very well.  The chest area was just a tad loose, but that typically happens when I try on dresses...nothing a more padded bra couldn't fix!  The cut and fit were very figure flattering.  By the end of the evening I experience a little chafing under my arms from the sequins, but that was after 5 hours and it was very minor.  Thank you RTR for a great first experience, I'll definitely be back!
