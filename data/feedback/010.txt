The dress was very flattering and fit perfectly through my stomach and hips. I have a booty so I always worry about how things are going to fit, but this was amazing. I have a small chest and didn't fill out the built in bra as much as I would have liked, but it still looked great and I was comfortable in it. The dress had more stretch and give than I thought it would. I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy dancing and while I couldn't bust out break dance moves, I was able to dance without feeling completely restricted. I am always a zero in dresses and this fit true to size. I'm short, 5'3" and I thought the length was perfect with a heel. Overall I'm very pleased with my order!! Thank you RTR!
