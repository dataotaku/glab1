I loved everything about this dress! Well made with a great color combination ( pictures don't do it justice). My issue was after just having a baby, it did not hide the area I needed hiding & because of the way the skirt is shaped made me look slightly bigger. I think it the top dropped down just a tad longer it would have looked better. Not the fault of the dress. My body just did not work well with this style
