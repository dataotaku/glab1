I have always been petite in my upper body and extremely athletic. 
I'm 5'9 and typically am a size 4,6,8 due to the fact I had a smaller upper frame and 34B cup. Depends what fabric were talking about too! 
However, because I have been lifting weights my back has grown (odd to add- but figured I'd say it knowing other people lift weights) My lat area is so wide that I was suffocating in a size 6. If I wasn't as muscular in my back I would've been fine. I would recommend to go up a size if you are into lifting weights and very broad in your upper body.
