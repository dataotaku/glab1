I rented this for my company's black tie awards banquet.  I liked that this dress was short but was a little fancier with the sequins. (I generally don't care for long dresses.)  I would describe the color as more rose gold than yellow gold.  I have blonde hair and fair skin, and the color was very flattering.  This is a very forgiving dress! It's form fitting without making you feel like you're squeezed into it.  I would rent this one again.  Highly recommend!
