Wore to work

Super cute; love the 3/4 length sleeves. With a wider sleeve, I always want something shorter so that it doesn't drag. I wore with black pants and pumps for the office, but could have dressed down with jeans too. If I didn't hate ironing so much (and this shirt definitely needs to be ironed!!) I would have bought it. The gathering at the sleeves prevents this from being too big overall.

Note: wear with high-waisted pants or you'll show your stomach. Ladies who are smaller across the shoulders could probably size down one, but I like the oversized fit.
