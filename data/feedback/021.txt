Perfect for a spring wedding!

I rented this dress for a spring wedding. I had originally rented an 8 and 10 and when I saw that the straps were quite long (make sure you wear them criss-crossed), I contacted the RTR customer service who suggested sizing down. I did that and ended up wearing the 6. It fit great. I wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day! The top is fitted, so that helped to keep everything still while I was on the dance floor, too. The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party. The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long! I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt. I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want! Lastly, I wore the Tova Blue Mohawk earrings which seem like they were made for this dress. Compliments on those as well. I can always count on RTR to make me look like a million bucks!
