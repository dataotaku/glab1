This dress is just darling. I would absolutely wear it again. It fits true to size with a little room. I have larger hips and this dress fit fine and highlighted my smaller waist.  It isn't too tight around your middle and I was really comfortable in this one. I wore it out to dinner in Vegas and really felt amazing.
