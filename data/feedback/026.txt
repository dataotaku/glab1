Absolutely beautiful dress. The details were incredible. 

Pros:
-Unique 
-Elegant and sophisticated

Cons
-Extremely tight in the bust area (I had to wear a bra with no padding and it was still extremely tight). I don't know if sizing up would be ideal, as every other portion of the dress fit well.
