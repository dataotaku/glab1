Such an easy dress! Danced all night!

This dress is absolutely perfect! I originally grabbed this dress in the Georgetown RTR store as a back-up because it just looked pretty "eh" while on the hanger, but when I tried it on, I instantly felt like a princess. I loved how it flowed, and it was such an easy dress to dance in all night. I'm 5' 6" - 5' 7", and the dress was about an inch or two too long, and there is way too much fabric and layering to hem it with the tape they sell at RTR, but that was easy to fix with one inch Jack Roger wedges (easier to dance in as well :)). Overall, the dress was amazing, the colors photographed perfectly, and  I felt great at my senior prom.
