Ordered this as a replacement dress

I ordered this dress as a replacement because I thought my original order would be too small.  This dress fit my abdomen well, but it hung slack around my shoulders and neck.  I wouldn't recommend a large size for apple body shapes; get the smaller size and let it hug you!
