Great dress for a wedding with long ceremonies and lots of dancing.

It fit perfectly - I have a small waist, normal-to-small bust and big hips, so it fit in all of the right places. It was borderline too short, but I usually prefer a bit of length. It was still easy to dance and sit in. I got lots of compliments and finally recommended RTR to a few friends!
